1.	Create Three level nested directory a,b and c

   mkdir -p a/b/c


b)Create at least one normal text file in each directory
   
    touch filea.txt ./b/fileb.txt ./b/c/filec.txt
    
c)Copy c into a

  cp -r /c /a
  
  d)Copy file inside a into b
  
    cp file.txt b
	

 2.Change the third level directory c permission to read only
 
    chmod +r c
	
 3.Try copying third level c directory to outside of a
 
    cp b/c../
	
4.	Create the directory  “data“ inside b

     mkdir data

5.	Change the permission of b to read and write only

    chmod +rw b

6.	Create directory “data2”  inside b

    mkdir data2

7.	Create data.txt file inside b

    touch data.txt

8.	Rename the second level directory c to copied_dir

     mv c copied_dir

9.	Change permission of copied_dir to only executable

     chmod +x copied_dir

10.	Try ls on copied_dir

   ls cannot run because of executable only cannot read

11.	Try moving copied_dir to outside of a

     cannot move dir to outside because of restriced permissions

12.	Try moving data directory outside of a

     cannot move, permission access denied

13.	Now change the owner of the directory a to root

    

14.	Change permission of a to read write and executable to only user

     mkdir sample

16.	Create directory x outside a

     mkdir ../x

17.	Try moving x inside a

    mv x ./a


18.	Create directory movies

    mkdir movies

19.	Change group of movies to sudo

    sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser
      

20.	Change group of movies to avahi

   chgrp scifi myfile
	
	  ls -l myfile

21.	Try changing permission after changing ownership to root

        sudo chmod --recursive a+rwx /tmp

22.	Try Changing permission after changing group to sudo without sudo

    pkexec chmod go-w /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so
